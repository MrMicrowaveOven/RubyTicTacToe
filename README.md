# Tic-Tac-Toe

This was just a fun exercise to make a quick Tic-Tac-Toe game in Ruby.  The computer player will learn from won or lost games, and get better over time.

# To Use

`ruby PLAYGAME.rb` is all you gots to do.

Here's a quick one-liner to clone it and play from the command line.

`git clone https://github.com/MrMicrowaveOven/RubyTicTacToe.git && cd RubyTicTacToe && ruby PLAYGAME.rb`

And here's a one-liner to clone it, install rspec, and run the tests.

`git clone https://github.com/MrMicrowaveOven/RubyTicTacToe.git && cd RubyTicTacToe && gem install rspec && rspec`
